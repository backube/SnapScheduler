# Documentation

snapscheduler enables taking [snapshots of Kubernetes Persistent
Volumes](https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/storage/volume-snapshots/)
according to a defined schedule. Each schedule defines how often a new snapshot
should be created as well as the retention policy for the snapshots (i.e., the
maximum number to retain and/or for how long).

## Requirements

The snapscheduler operator is designed to work with Kubernetes [CSI-based
storage
drivers](https://kubernetes.io/blog/2019/01/15/container-storage-interface-ga/)
that are capable of taking volume snapshots.

Kubernetes version compatibility:

| snapscheduler | Kubernetes    | `snapshot.storage.k8s.io` |
|---------------|---------------|---------------------------|
| 1.0           | 1.13 -- 1.16  | `v1alpha1`                |
| 1.1           | 1.13 -- 1.18+ | `v1alpha1`, `v1beta1`     |
| master        | 1.13 -- 1.18+ | `v1alpha1`, `v1beta1`     |
